Ten years have passed since that adventure. Alice (Mia Watsikovska), who once roamed the wonderland, has lived in a magnificent and rich manor at the age of 19. 

She has no worries about food, clothing and luxury. 

Driven by the social atmosphere, she has gradually grown up into the kind of aristocratic woman in her family's mind, but has long forgotten her wonderful experiences at the age of 9. 

As time went by, at the family's 19th birthday party for her, a rich son proposed to him. The other party was Hamish Escott (Leo Bill). 

Although Hamish had great wealth, his personality was silly and dull, and he was not with Alice at all. 

Alice realized that she did not want such a life. She was eager to change the status quo. 

Under the leadership of the rabbit, Alice went into fairyland again.

It's still the place where she spent her childhood. Nothing has changed much. 

Mr. Crazy Hat (Johnny Depp) with a fantastic yellow pupil welcomed Alice first.

While the arbitrary and fierce Red Queen (Helena Birham Carter) still screamed to cut off the heads of others, even her sister, the White Queen (Anne Hathaway).

Ornaments are not let go.

With the help of her twin brothers (Matt Lucas), Alice gradually regains her memory and will re-examine herself in this fabulous world.
